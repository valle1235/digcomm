% Determines when to sample the matched filter outputs. The synchronization
% algorithm is based on cross-correlating a replica of the (known)
% transmitted training sequence with the output from the matched filter
% (before sampling). Different starting points in the matched filter output
% are tried and the shift yielding the largest value of the absolute value
% of the cross-correlation is chosen as the sampling instant for the first
% symbol.
%
% Input:
%   mf            = matched filter output, complex baseband, I+jQ
%   b_train       = the training sequence bits
%   Q             = number of samples per symbol
%   t_start       = start of search window
%   t_end         = end of search window
%
% Output:
%   t_samp = sampling instant for first symbol
    b_train_qpsk = qpsk(b_train);
    corr = xcorr(b_train_qpsk,mf);
    corr = abs(corr(t_start:t_end));
    [~,alignment] = max(corr); %Find the correct alignment of mf
    t_samp = (alignment+t_start-1)/Q;
